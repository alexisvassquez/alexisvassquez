# I'm Alexis

I'm a **modular software engineer** and **digital designer** who builds expressive systems that fuse code, audio, visual design, and creativity.

I’m the creator of **AudioMIX,** an open-source audio architecture and music production software that analyzes mood and tempo, maps emotional state to light and color, and interfaces with hardware like Arduino and modular CLI tools. I believe in empowering independent artists and building tools that feel alive.

I started coding in 1999 as a nerdy kid designing static Neopets sites in HTML/CSS — and never stopped. Despite how often I was told “coding isn’t for girls,” I kept going, working in the terminal, building systems from scratch, and refusing to disappear.

Today, I blend software engineering with digital design, working across various languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools.

## 🧠 Languages
Python, C/C++, CMake, JavaScript, Rust, TypeScript, Bash, HTML, CSS, SQL, JSON, Markdown, PHP, Dart, Powershell, *AudioScript* (Custom AudioMIX DSL)

I'm a Meta Verified digital content creator, Google Developer (GDG Miami), open-source contributor, and proud Linux power user (Ubuntu > macOS, any day). I build using a mutant ChromeOS/Ubtuntu-hybridChromebook named **Chrom-E**.
If you’re building something creative, audio-driven, or modular — let’s connect.  
**Freelance and collaboration inquiries welcome.**
